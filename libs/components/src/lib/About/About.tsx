              Hey there! I'm a 23-year-old programmer hailing from the vibrant land of Romania. For
              the past 6 years, I've been immersed in the world of coding. I've spent time at
              companies like Trimble and Ensemble Software, as well as 2 years as a full stack
              developer during my college years. This year, I proudly completed my studies in
              electrical engineering and computer science. Curiosity drives meâ€”I'm always eager to
              learn and discuss new ideas. Beyond tech, I'm a huge fan of both movies and TV series.
              The art of cinematography never ceases to amaze me.
